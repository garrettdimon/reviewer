      # Removes any unhelpful rake exit status details from $stderr. Reviewew uses `exit` when a
      #   command fails so that the resulting command-line exit status can be interpreted correctly
      #   in CI and similar environments. Without that exit status, those environments wouldn't
      #   recognize the failure. As a result, Rake almost always adds noise that begins with the value
      #   in RAKE_EXIT_DRIVEL when `exit` is called. Frequently, that RAKE_EXIT_DRIVEL is the only
      #   information in $stderr, and it's not helpful in the human-readable output, but other times
      #   when a valid exception occurs, there's useful error information preceding RAKE_EXIT_DRIVEL.
      #   So this ensures that the unhelpful part is always removed so the output is cluttered with
      #   red herrings since the command is designed to fail with an exit status of 1 under normal
      #   operation with tool failures.
