      # Future Configuration Options:
      # - seed_substitution_value(string): Currently a constant of `$SEED` in Reviewer::Command, but
      #   may need to be configurable in case any command-line strings have other legitimate uses
      #   for the value such that it may need to be override. Ideally, it woudl be changed to3
      #   something obscure enough that conflicts wouldn't happen, but you never know
      # - benchmark_everything(:dev, :optimize): Use the `time_up` gem to measure and show all the results
      #   for each tool and step to help identify and reduce bottlenecks. It would mainly be a flag
      #   for use in development, but it could also help folks troubleshoot their speed in finer
      #   detail than the standard Reviewer output
      # - default_preparation_refresh(integer time): Right now, it's hard-coded at 6 hours, but that may require
      #   tuning for individual tools
