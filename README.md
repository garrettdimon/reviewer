# [Reviewer](https://github.com/garrettdimon/reviewer)

**Note:** As of December 2021, Reviewer is a work in progress. While it's working great reviewing its own code, it's not quite ready for wider usage. Once, it's ready, it will provide more helpful installation and usage details.

*With Reviewer, you can seamlessly use multiple automated code review tools with orders of magnitude less friction so you can use them more frequently and consistently.*

So instead of remembering and typing...
```bash
$ yarn audit --level moderate
$ bundle exec bundle-audit check --no-update
$ bundle exec rubocop --parallel
$ bundle exec erblint --lint-all --enable-all-linters
$ yarn stylelint .
$ yarn eslint .
```
...you could just type...
```
$ rvw
```

That's just the tip of the iceberg, though. For the full story on Reviewer's capabilities and benefits, the [Overview](https://github.com/garrettdimon/reviewer/wiki/Overview) is the best place to start. Or if you'd like to see how it's configured under the hood, the [Configuration Instructions](https://github.com/garrettdimon/reviewer/wiki/Configuration) go even deeper.
